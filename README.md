#### Mern version of my capstone 

Changed the backend to Node, Express,mongoDb and Typescripts. This added a hole new difficulty to the capstone in that I do not have a lot of exprieance with typed languages
and using typescript was actuall a lot of fun to figure out. As well as using the JWT With node for the first time and hash the users password

#### Changes to the front end 

in the front end I am changing up some of the logic in order to work better with the mongoDB and this is my first time incorporating Redux into react.
